Some functions of NyanMaths return points,
here is the way to use them...

How to create a point :
>>> name = Coords (x, y)

Properties :    (~ : editable)
   x ~
   y ~

Operators :
   Comparisons :
      Equals to (operator ==) : returns True if the two operands are the same
      Not equals to (operator !=) : returns True if the two operands aren't the same


Example :

>>> my_point = Coords (4, -2)

>>> my_point.y
-2

>>> p =Polynomial (1, -1, -1)   Creates a second degree polynomial

>>> my_point = p.summit   my_point is the summit of p

>>> my_point

 (0.5 ; -1.25)   It's a Coords object !

>>> my_point.x = 1

>>> my_point

 (1 ; -1.25)
