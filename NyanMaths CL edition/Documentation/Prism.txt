How to create a Prism :
>>> name = Prism (base surface, height)

Properties :    (~ : editable)
   baseSurface ~
   height ~
   volume

Operators :
   Multiplication (operator *) : returns a scaled up prism
   Division (operator /) : returns a scaled down prism

   Multiplication (operator *=) : scale up the prism
   Division (operator /=) : scale down the prism

   Comparisons :
      Equals to (operator ==) : returns True if the two operands are the same
      Not equals to (operator !=) : returns True if the two operands aren't the same


Example :

>>> my_prism = Prism (10, 3)     Creates my_prism (base surface = 10, height = 3)

>>> my_prism.volume     Returns my_prism's volume
30

>>> my_prism *= 2     Multiply my_prism's measures by 3 (base surface = 40, height = 6)

>>> another_prism = Prism (11, 6)     Create another_prism (base surface = 11, height = 6)

>>> another_prism != my_prism     Aren't another_prism and my_prism equal ?
True
