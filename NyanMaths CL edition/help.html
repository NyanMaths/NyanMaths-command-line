				When you run the main application from the GUI launcher, you can see this :

				<br /><br /><br /> Something like help...
				<br /><br />> What can I do ? _

				<br /><br />It means this application works !
				<br />It may not displays this, please reinstall this program in this case because it must be corrupted.
				<br />Disable your anti-malware during the second installation.

				<br /><br />This application works with command lines : if you want to do something, you must input a command
				<br />in the console.
				<br />Example :

				<br /><br />> square(6)
				<br /> 36

				<br /><br />It returns the square of 6 !

				<br /><br />If you want to read the help, tick the option "If you need any help" in the launcher and it will display
				<br />the help about the functions :

				<br /><br />In version 1.0.1)

				<br /><br />| Help about NyanMaths CL 1.0.1:
				<br />|  
				<br />|&nbsp Description :
				<br />|&nbsp &nbsp Here, there is the documentation of this application !
				<br />|  
				<br />|&nbsp Functions :
				<br />|&nbsp &nbsp square(x):
				<br />|&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Returns the square of x
				<br />|  
				<br />|&nbsp &nbsp cube(x):
				<br />|&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Returns the cube of x
				<br />|  
				<br />|&nbsp &nbsp sqrt(x):

				<br />|  

				<br /><br />You have halp about all functions : their parameters and what they do !
				<br />It is magic !
				<br />But, it is not finished...

				<br /><br />There is mathematical tools in this app : you can launch them as other functions,
				<br />by typing their name :

				<br /><br />>>> tool_name ()
				<br />...

				<br /><br />In the last version, there is 7 tools :

				<br /><br />- primes
				<br />- dividers
				<br />- UIR (Relationship between intensity, elecric tension and resistance)
				<br />- PUI (Relationship between intensity, elecric tension and power)
				<br />- VDT (Relationship between speed, distance and time)
				<br />- MVD (Relationship between density, weight and volume)
				<br />- temperature (Convert °F to °C, for example)

				<br /><br />If you need some help about an application, run it !

				<br /><br />>>> primes ()

				<br /><br />&nbsp This application calculates all prime numbers
				<br />&nbsp from an odd positive no null number to... An other greater odd positive number !
				<br />&nbsp Beware : the last numbers will be deleted !

				<br />&nbsp Calculate the prime numbers from...

				<br /><br />All tools have a short description, cool !


				<br /><br /><br />If you want, you can do some operations :
				<br />In the command line interface, input "operations()" to get all
				<br />operations you can do.
				<br />For example :

				<br /><br />>>> 5 + 5
				<br />10
				<br />>>> 9 * 2
				<br />18
				<br />>>> 6**2 &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Equals to 6² or power(6, 2)
				<br />36

				<br /><br />You can use the return-values of the functions :

				<br /><br />>>> fact(5) + 3
				<br />123
				<br />>>> 9.2 - abs(9)
				<br />0.2
				
				<br /><br />You can also use complex numbers like this :
				<br />If you want to use "i" notation, write a * i insthead of aj)
				<br /><br />>>> (3 + 2j) / 2
				<br />(1.5 + j)
				
				<br /><br />You can also use logical operators :
				<br /> &nbsp &nbsp Greater than : >
				<br /> &nbsp &nbsp Lesser than : <
				<br /> &nbsp &nbsp Equals : == (Yes, two !)
				<br /> &nbsp &nbsp Not equals : !=
				
				<br /><br />>>> 5 + 5 == 10
				<br />True
				
				<br /><br />>>> 6 * 7 < 20
				<br />False
				
				<br /><br /><br />There is a lot of constant values since 3.1 version :
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Gravitationnal constants (m / s²) : prefixed by g.</li>
				<li>Weight constants (kg) : prefixed by w.</li>
				<li>Measures constants (m) : prefixed by m.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				<br />Note : You can have the complete list if you check "Display constants values" in the launcher.
				
				<br /><br />If you want to use one of this constants :
				
				<br /><br />>>> 68 * g.earth
				<br />666.8521999...
				
				<br /><br />>>> m.ly * 13.7 * 10**9
				<br />1.2961200747435696e+26 &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The radius of the visible universe in meters !
				
				<br /><br />
			</p>
			<h2 id = "advanced">(2) Advanced use</h2>
			<p>
				<br /><br />There's a functionnality to create objects like cubes, cones or vectors.
				<br />If you want to use it, tick the check box "Load all modules when you start" in the launcher.

				<br /><br />It is sample : create an object like this :

				<br /><br />>>> my_object = Square (5) &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A square with a length of 5 arbitrary unit has been created !

				<br /><br />You can see you have to give the side of the square : you will give different data for different objects.

				<br /><br />Here is the list of the objects which you can create :
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Square(side)</li>
				<br /><li>Rectangle(length, width)</li>
				<br /><li>Cube(edge)</li>
				<br /><li>Cuboid(length, width, height)</li>
				<br /><li>Ball(radius)</li>
				<br /><li>Disk(radius)</li>
				<br /><li>Cone(base radius, height)</li>
				<br /><li>Cylinder(radius, height)</li>
				<br /><li>Prism(base surface, height)</li>
				<br /><li>Pyramid(base surface, height)</li>
				<br /><li>Ellipsoid(a b, c)</li>
				<br /><li>Ellipse(a, b)</li>
				<br /><li>Polygon(number of sides, side length)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				<br />When you have created your beautiful square, what can you do with it ?

				<br /><br />If you want to get a data from your object, do this :

				<br /><br />>>> my_object.data_name

				<br /><br />For example :

				<br /><br />>>> my_square = Square (6)
				<br />>>> my_square.side
				<br />6

				<br /><br />You get the side of your square !
				<br />But, you know already it, why not ask surface ?

				<br /><br />>>> my_square = Square (3.5)
				<br />>>> my_square.surface
				<br />12.25

				<br /><br />Wonderful !
				<br />But, what can I know about my cubes or prisms ?
				<br />Do not panic, look at this :

				<br /><br />Square :
				<br />&nbsp &nbsp side
				<br />&nbsp &nbsp apothem
				<br />&nbsp &nbsp diagonale
				<br />&nbsp &nbsp perimeter
				<br />&nbsp &nbsp surface
				<br />&nbsp &nbsp circumcircle (a Disk object)
				<br />&nbsp &nbsp inscribedCircle (a Disk object)

				<br /><br />Rectangle :
				<br />&nbsp &nbsp length
				<br />&nbsp &nbsp width
				<br />&nbsp &nbsp perimeter
				<br />&nbsp &nbsp surface
				<br />&nbsp &nbsp diagonale
				<br />&nbsp &nbsp circumcircle (a Disk object)
				<br />&nbsp &nbsp inscribedCircle (a Disk object)
				

				<br /><br />Cube :
				<br />&nbsp &nbsp edge
				<br />&nbsp &nbsp volume
				<br />&nbsp &nbsp surface
				<br />&nbsp &nbsp diagonale

				<br /><br />Cuboid :
				<br />&nbsp &nbsp length
				<br />&nbsp &nbsp width
				<br />&nbsp &nbsp heigth
				<br />&nbsp &nbsp surface
				<br />&nbsp &nbsp volume
				<br />&nbsp &nbsp diagonale

				<br /><br />Ball :
				<br />&nbsp &nbsp radius
				<br />&nbsp &nbsp diameter
				<br />&nbsp &nbsp surface
				<br />&nbsp &nbsp volume

				<br /><br />Disk :
				<br />&nbsp &nbsp radius
				<br />&nbsp &nbsp diameter
				<br />&nbsp &nbsp perimeter
				<br />&nbsp &nbsp surface

				<br /><br />Cone :
				<br />&nbsp &nbsp radius
				<br />&nbsp &nbsp diameter
				<br />&nbsp &nbsp baseSurface
				<br />&nbsp &nbsp height
				<br />&nbsp &nbsp volume
				<br />&nbsp &nbsp lateralSurface

				<br /><br />Cylinder :
				<br />&nbsp &nbsp radius
				<br />&nbsp &nbsp diameter
				<br />&nbsp &nbsp baseSurface
				<br />&nbsp &nbsp height
				<br />&nbsp &nbsp surface
				<br />&nbsp &nbsp volume

				<br /><br />Prism :
				<br />&nbsp &nbsp baseSurface
				<br />&nbsp &nbsp height
				<br />&nbsp &nbsp volume

				<br /><br />Pyramid :
				<br />&nbsp &nbsp baseSurface
				<br />&nbsp &nbsp height
				<br />&nbsp &nbsp volume
				
				<br /><br />Ellipsoid :
				<br />&nbsp &nbsp a
				<br />&nbsp &nbsp b
				<br />&nbsp &nbsp c
				<br />&nbsp &nbsp volume
				
				<br /><br />Ellipse :
				<br />&nbsp &nbsp a
				<br />&nbsp &nbsp b
				<br />&nbsp &nbsp perimeter
				<br />&nbsp &nbsp surface
				
				<br /><br />Polygon :
				<br />&nbsp &nbsp nSides (Number of sides)
				<br />&nbsp &nbsp side
				<br />&nbsp &nbsp apothem
				<br />&nbsp &nbsp perimeter
				<br />&nbsp &nbsp surface
				<br />&nbsp &nbsp circumcircle (a Disk object)
				<br />&nbsp &nbsp inscribedCircle (a Disk object)
				
				
				<br /><br /><br />You can also get the documentation of these objects as follows :
				
				<br /><br />> doc(Cylinder, Cube or Ellipse)

				<br /><br /><br />If you want to change data of your objects, do this (or write this) :

				<br /><br />>>> ball = Ball(23)
				<br />>>> ball.radius
				<br />23
				<br />>>> ball.radius = 10
				<br />>>> ball.radius
				<br />10

				<br /><br />Fantastic !
				<br />You can change object's data like this.
				<br />But, you can't change everything : if you try this :

				<br /><br />>>> my_rect = Rectangle (2, 3)
				<br />>>> my_rect.surface = 65
				<br /><br />Impossible to change it !

				<br /><br />My application is angry !
				<br />Indeed, you can not do that : it is not allowed because
				<br />we can not change the surface of a rectangle, it is not possible.
				<img src = "Rage_kit.gif" alt = "RAGE" />
				
				<br /><br />If you want to display all properties of your object, just write its name :
				<br /><br />>>> my_square = Square (5.5)
				<br />>>>my_square
				<br /><br />Type : Square
				<br />Side : 5.5
				<br />Perimeter : 22.0
				<br />Surface : 30.25
				<br />Apothem : 2.75
				<br />Diagonale : 7.778174593052023
				
				<br /><br />Note that since v2.6, it displays a GUI instead of console.
				
				<br /><br />You can do operations with your objects (homothety), it is sample :
				
				<br /><br />>>> s = Square (2)
				<br />>>> s * 3
				<br /><br />Type : Square
				<br />Side : 6
				<br />Perimeter : 24
				<br />Surface : 36
				<br />Apothem : 3
				<br />Diagonale : 8.485281374238571
				
				<br /><br />It transform your object by homothety !
				<br />Be careful : the previous example doesn't modify your object.
				<br />You can transform your object like this :
				
				<br /><br />>>> s *= 3 &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Multiply the measures 3 times
				<br />>>> s /= 3 &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Restore the old measures
				
				<br /><br />Since 2.4.1, there is a new class : the Polynomial.
				<br />You can initialize it like this :
				
				<br /><br />>>> p = Polynomial (1, 5, -3)
				
				<br /><br />It created a 2nd degree polynomial (x² + 5x - 3)!
				<br />But you can only create a 2nd degree polynimial with it, sorry...
				<br />You can now access to the roots or the summit of this polynomial !
				
				<br /><br />>>> p
				<br />Type : Polynomial (2nd degree)
				<br />Expression : 1x² + 5x + -3
				<br />Discriminant : 37
				<br />Reduced discriminant : 9.25
				<br />Root 1 :  -5.541
				<br />Root 2 :  0.541
				<br />Summit :  (-2.5 ; -9.25)
				<br />Derivee : 2x + 5
				
				<br /><br />There is a few functionnalities around it :
				<br />&nbsp &nbsp - Evaluate polynomial with a value : p.evaluate (x)
				<br />&nbsp &nbsp - Get the discriminant : p.dsc
				<br />&nbsp &nbsp - Get the reduced discriminant : p.reducedDsc
				<br />&nbsp &nbsp - Get a : p.a
				<br />&nbsp &nbsp - Get b : p.b
				<br />&nbsp &nbsp - Get c : p.c
				<br />&nbsp &nbsp - Get the first root : p.root1
				<br />&nbsp &nbsp - Get the second root : p.root2
				<br />&nbsp &nbsp - Get the summit of the parabola : p.summit

				<br /><br />To finish, there is a special object type : the vector.
				<br />I do not explain to you what is a vector, Internet is you friend !
				<br />You can create a vector as a ball or a square :

				<br /><br />>>> my_vector = Vector (5, 7.5)
				<br />>>> my_vector

				<br /><br /> &nbsp (5 &nbsp &nbsp 7.5)
				<br /> &nbsp Length : 9.014

				<br /><br />The length is... the length of you vector on an orthonormal plane.
				<br />So, you can use the vectors like this :

				<br /><br />>>> v1 = Vector (5, 6)
				<br />>>> v2 = Vector (-6, 3)
				<br />>>> v1 + v2
				<br /><br /> &nbsp (-1 9)
				<br /> &nbsp Length : 9.055
				<br /><br />>>>v1 * 5
				<br />...

				<br /><br />You can add, substract, multiply and divide vectors with vectors or numbers ; test it !

				<br /><br />It is all, now, you can use the full application !

				<br /><br />Bye bye !<br /><br /><br />
