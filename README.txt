# NyanMaths-command-line
NyanMaths command line edition is a mathematical software made with Python. It is currently WIP and needs a quite complete rewrite because it is so poorly programmed...

To use it, you have to enter a command such as :

> 5 + 0.1
 5.1

You can use basic mathematical functions :

> sin (pi) + 3
 3

This app allows you to create and edit physical objects like squares or cubes,
computes their properties and draw them in a GUI.
 
You can directly edit the source code of NyanMaths CL and distribute your own version of it
thanks to LGPLv3 license.
